There are ten questions in total and you begin with two minutes on the timer. If an incorrect answer is chosen, the button is disabled and five seconds will be subtracted from the timer. A correct answer will bring the next question. At any point a question can be skipped by hitting the \"skip\" button, and the question will be added to the back of the queue. The quiz is completed when all questions are answered. Your score is equal to the time you have remaining. If the timer reaches zero, you will recieve a game over.</p></i>
